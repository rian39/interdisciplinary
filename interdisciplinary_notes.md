# Creating inter-disciplinary space and _ethoi_ -- and publication

## Sources

Barry and Born
Rabinow and Stavrianakis
Lynch on epistopics
Foucault on discipline

## Ideas

- the pedagogical space is important, both as student and teacher
- ethnography as an interdisciplinary ethos
- relation to science is particularly complex, because of many different sciences, and the fact that science is technoscience
- the nature of a discipline -- Andrew Abbott on this? Foucault on science; Haraway on figurations/stories; Deleuze and Guattari on concepts/functions/affects
- where is the interdisciplinary? Not necessarily in your mural space? Maybe need to find extra-mural spaces as well
- talk about DSI here and its interdisciplinary promise; from Hilary Mason to Watson; etc
- experience of working with genomic scientists, computer scientists, synthetic biologists, and above all statisticians
- experience of working with artists and performers
- distinguish different kinds of inter-disciplinarity 
    - creative economy 
    - politics of knowledge
- the formation of the inter-disciplinary subject


## Introduction

I guess my thinking is mainly oriented to Andrew Barry and Georgina Born's account of interdisciplinary in [@Barry_2007]. They write there:

> how the forms of interdisciplinary research addressed by our project have been explicitly or implicitly driven not only by the rationales of fostering accountability or innovation, but by an orientation towards effecting ontological change. This may be manifest, as we will show, in intentions to re-conceive both the object(s) of research and the relations between research subjects and objects. [@Barry_2008, 25] 

The two poles they identify here orient my own experiences. On the one hand, interdisciplinarity as a mode of accountability and innovation for technosciences in their engagements with publics has been prominent. At the same, time interdisciplinarity as a transformation, as effecting ontological change has also been there.

Barry and Born in their study compared projects in IT, climate change and art-science. My own experience is less broad than this, but does include scientists, artists, designers, engineers, statisticians, as well as much work with people in adjacent disciplines such as anthropology, history, art history where interdisciplinarity also matters, but perhaps in less stressful forms. I count eight research projects I have been substantially involved in as interdisciplinary in the sense that Barry and Born describe. I should mention that my own erratic academic trajectory is also interdisciplinary -- a degree in Physics, followed by law, then philosophy and fine arts, a phd in philosophy, but working computer science, media and cultural studies, science studies and sociology. This is not a sensible or even deliberate academic trajectory, but one that has repeated moments where I found myself crossing between disciplines. This is both an institutional and embodied movement, since a desk in the computer science department, or the archaeology department feels quite different to a desk in sociology. In some ways, my own investment in certain interdisciplinary practices stems from that history, a history itself that has deeper roots. 

## Vignettes on interdisciplinarity

- vignette as a small vine; vignette as ornamentation put around a graphic in a book -- the vines that wrap around the graphic; literary sense of vignette as a brief episode.
- appropriate here too that vignettes relate to publishing. One sign of interdisciplinarity comes from publication, however thought. 
- for the last decade or so, I've found myself working quite a lot with graphic forms as interdisciplinary materials. Sometimes graphics open up different pathways of conversation, and they tend to perturb the recumbent speaking positions encouraged by disciplinary formations, even if only provisionally and temporarily. 

### 2004 Wisdom decision support: bringing management scientists, computer scientists and others around decisions

- in this case, working as a computer scientist, albeit a lesser one, the software developer, for project peopled by management scientists. 
- build software that would allow people to collectively structure their decisions about wicked problems, problems for which there is simple operational procedure. 
- my work -- a year of it more of less was focusing on making graphic forms on screens that documented and guided groups of people trying to work out what to do. The form of these diagrams was dictated by management science, or a particular branch of it known as soft systems. Which was fine. 
- But in practice, the only instance of non-academic practice I participated in with this team, which took place in a UK government department in Westminster, the tool and its diagrammatic form became a more or less complicated notebook for a group discussion that was skilfully facilitated by a soft systems consultant. 
- the resulting publication, perhaps one of the most highly cited papers I've been an author on,  promotes the diagramming tool as the innovation. The reality was somewhat different, but the publication itself is a form of accountability to the funders of this interdisciplinary project. 
- the diagram worked for accountability, but didn't have much chance in terms of ontological change. 

### 2007 bringing designers and social scientists together around science

- a year long programme whose ambition was to bring critical design into dialogue with social sciences around emerging problems of security, protection and emergency, post-9/11.
- designers were very skilled in making visual forms, in quickly taking up any materials and putting them together to make things, usually visible things, but sometimes events, sounds, etc
- 

### 2009 bringing synthetic biologists and social scientists together around design

### 2011 bringing together genomic scientists and ethnographers around databases

- project funded by computer scientists, but funding was for social scientists to work with genomic and environmental scientists around the transformations in scientific data
- the transformations were largely understood in terms of a notion 'data intensive' - that is, scientists wrestling with infrastructural changes that seemed to be occurring at pace much faster than scientific knowledge itself. 
- this time as a sociologist, we were working with life scientists, and again the focus was on diagrams and graphic forms
- the idea was to find the most heavily used data graphics amongst the relevant community of scientists by looking through lots of scientific journal articles and powerpoint presentations, and get the groups of scientists to annotate them, talk about them in relation to what they showed about scientific data, and what they didn't. 
- again, the idea was the interdisciplinary ethos might flourish if we didn't talk too much, but instead looked at things together.
- this attempt yielded some interesting results:
    - the scientists argued with each other about the graphics and the diagrams, and whether they matter or not
    - they told us that the diagrams they were using their own presentations were wrong, outdated, used only for rhetorical purposes, or full of problems
    - they told us that diagrams for the things we were interested in  -- like who used what data from what database -- were simply availabel
- a public lecture at the eSciences Institute, University of Edinburgh to present the results of this work to our sponsors, who were basically computer scientists : 2 people in the audience -- they don't care; their accounting was somehow achieved but the very existence of an interdisciplinary project. 

### 2013 Making diagrams for genomic scientists

- funding to take this work further, this time from esocial science, but our idea was to do some ontological change: bring new diagrams into the world through conversation with scientists
- went back to some of the same people, asking them about how data was moving around, what infrastructures
- joined up with statisticians to begin creating diagrams of dynamics in scientific data and made some new diagrams that we published to our scientific friends using
    - blogs and twitter
    - further workshop presentations, including some diagrams of various kinds elicit different reactions:
        - cool, say the bioinformaticians; rubbish metrics say some clinicians; that can't be right say database administrators; but industry conferences started inviting us to present;
- two results -- 
    - we found some things that certain scientists did not want to see, but others found interesting
    - working with statisticians in order to make sense of scientific databases brought in new interdisciplinary tensions, because what we were doing was not proper statistics.
    - some of the diagrams -- statisticians saw them as preliminary results, whereas we saw them as the translational objects we needed to bring back into other disciplines
    - some ontological change? - not sure -- by making these diagrams, which lie at the intersection of ethnography, bioinformatics and statistics, we found ourselves in some new conversations, not least of which was databases. _Things_ are a very important component of the interdisciplinary space
    - what about social scientists: 
        - a very famous figure in my own field asks: what are you doing? are you doing quality control for scientists?
        - reviewers in a social science journal that publish work in this area say: this is really interesting methodologically? The editors ask: did you do this? Is this your own work? Do you have permission to use these diagrams?

### 2014 bringing statisticians and ethnographers together around the field of software devices

### creating inter-disciplinary intersections between all sciences and engineering

## Reflections

- my vignettes are about vignettes -- sorry, that's being clever, but I think my interdisciplinarity is embodied in diagrams and forms of writing or annotation of them in concert or conflict with others
- I haven't spoken about shifting inter-space -- in both the sense of moving myself, and configuring spaces where different disciplines resonate or not with each other.
- interdisciplinarity is not just bilateral; it can be multilateral.
