# Creating inter-disciplinary space and _ethoi_

## Sources

Barry and Born
Rabinow and Stavrianakis
Lynch on epistopics
Foucault on discipline

## Ideas

- the pedagogical space is important, both as student and teacher
- ethnography as an interdisciplinary ethos
- relation to science is particularly complex, because of many different sciences, and the fact that science is technoscience
- the nature of a discipline -- Andrew Abbott on this? Foucault on science; Haraway on figurations/stories; Deleuze and Guattari on concepts/functions/affects
- where is the interdisciplinary? Not necessarily in your mural space? Maybe need to find extra-mural spaces as well
- talk about DSI here and its interdisciplinary promise; from Hilary Mason to Watson; etc
- experience of working with genomic scientists, computer scientists, synthetic biologists, and above all statisticians
- experience of working with artists and performers
- distinguish different kinds of inter-disciplinarity 
    - creative economy 
    - politics of knowledge
- the formation of the inter-disciplinary subject

## Quotes to use

> how the forms of interdisciplinary research addressed by our project have been explicitly or implicitly driven not only by the rationales of fostering accountability or innovation, but by an orientation towards effecting ontological change. This may be manifest, as we will show, in intentions to re-conceive both the object(s) of research and the relations between research subjects and objects. [@Barry_2008, 25]

### bringing together genomic scientists and ethnographers around databases

### bringing statisticians and ethnographers together around the field of software devices

### creating inter-disciplinary intersections between all sciences and engineering
