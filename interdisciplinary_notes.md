## Ideas

- the pedagogical space is important, both as student and teacher
- ethnography as an interdisciplinary ethos
- relation to science is particularly complex, because of many different sciences, and the fact that science is technoscience
- the nature of a discipline -- Andrew Abbott on this? Foucault on science; Haraway on figurations/stories; Deleuze and Guattari on concepts/functions/affects
- where is the interdisciplinary? Not necessarily in your mural space? Maybe need to find extra-mural spaces as well
- talk about DSI here and its interdisciplinary promise; from Hilary Mason to Watson; etc
- experience of working with genomic scientists, computer scientists, synthetic biologists, and above all statisticians
- experience of working with artists and performers
- distinguish different kinds of inter-disciplinarity 
    - creative economy 
    - politics of knowledge
- the formation of the inter-disciplinary subject
