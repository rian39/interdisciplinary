# Creating inter-disciplinary space and _ethoi_

## Sources

Barry and Born
Rabinow and Stavrianakis
Lynch on epistopics
Foucault on discipline

## Ideas

- the pedagogical space is important, both as student and teacher
- ethnography as an interdisciplinary ethos
- relation to science is particularly complex, because of many different sciences, and the fact that science is technoscience
- the nature of a discipline -- Andrew Abbott on this? Foucault on science; Haraway on figurations/stories; Deleuze and Guattari on concepts/functions/affects
- where is the interdisciplinary? Not necessarily in your mural space? Maybe need to find extra-mural spaces as well
- talk about DSI here and its interdisciplinary promise; from Hilary Mason to Watson; etc
- experience of working with genomic scientists, computer scientists, synthetic biologists, and above all statisticians
- experience of working with artists and performers
- distinguish different kinds of inter-disciplinarity 
    - creative economy 
    - politics of knowledge
- the formation of the inter-disciplinary subject

## Introduction

My thoughts about interdisciplinary research are very half-baked. I think I have quite a bit of interdisciplinary experience over the last 20 years. I guess my thinking is mainly oriented to Andrew Barry and Georgina Born's account of interdisciplinary in [@Barry_2007]. They write there:

> how the forms of interdisciplinary research addressed by our project have been explicitly or implicitly driven not only by the rationales of fostering accountability or innovation, but by an orientation towards effecting ontological change. This may be manifest, as we will show, in intentions to re-conceive both the object(s) of research and the relations between research subjects and objects. [@Barry_2008, 25] 

The two poles they identify here orient my own experiences. On the one hand, inter-disciplinarity as a mode of accountability and innovation for technosciences in their engagements with publics has been prominent. At the same, time interdisciplinarity as a transformation, as effecting ontological change has also been there.

Barry and Born in their study compared projects in IT, climate change and art-science. My own experience is less broad than this, but does include scientists, artists, designers, engineers, statisticians, as well as much work with people in adjacent disciplines such as anthropology, history, art history where interdisciplinarity also matters, but perhaps in less stressful forms. I count eight research projects I have been substantially involved in as interdisciplinary in the sense that Barry and Born describe. I should mention that my own erratic academic trajectory is also interdisciplinary -- a degree in Physics, followed by law, then philosophy and fine arts, a phd in philosophy, but working computer science, media and cultural studies, science studies and sociology. This is not a sensible or even deliberate academic trajectory, but one that has repeated moments where I found myself crossing between disciplines. This is both an institutional and embodied movement, since a desk in the computer science department, or the archaeology department feels quite different to a desk in sociology. In some ways, my own investment in certain interdisciplinary practices stems from that history, a history itself that has deeper roots. 

## Vignettes on interdisciplinarity

### bringing management scientists, computer scientists and social scientists around decisions

- build software that would allow people to collectively structure their decisions about wicked problems, problems for which there is simple operational procedure. 
- management scientists, computer scientists, and HM Customs and Revenue -- the whole thing is meant to be about software, but is actually about a skilled group facilitator, and his ability to engage the group.
- there working as a software developer/computer scientist whose own scepticism about the software they were building for the project was shared with other junior researchers in the project, but not accepted by the principal investigators, whose commitment to the technical vision was emphatic. 

### bringing designers and social scientists together around science

- a year long programme whose ambition was to bring critical design into dialogue with social sciences around emerging problems of security, protection and emergency, post-9/11.
- 

### bringing synthetic biologists and social scientists together around design

### bringing together genomic scientists and ethnographers around databases

### bringing statisticians and ethnographers together around the field of software devices

### creating inter-disciplinary intersections between all sciences and engineering

### a public lecture at the DIR, University of Edinburgh

- workshop brings together genomic scientists to talk about their own work and the infrastructural problems it encounters;
- workshop brings together environmental and earth scientists to talk about their own work and the infrastructural problems it encounters;
